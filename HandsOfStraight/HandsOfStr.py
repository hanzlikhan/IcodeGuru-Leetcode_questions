# # Example usage:
# hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8]
# groupSize = 3
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.isNStraightHand(hand, groupSize))  # Output: True
# Explanation:
# Initial Check: The function first checks if the length of the hand is a multiple of groupSize. If not, it's impossible to divide the hand into the required groups, so it returns False.
# Counting Occurrences: A dictionary count is used to count the occurrences of each card in the hand.
# Sorting Keys: The keys of the count dictionary are sorted to process the smallest card values first.
# Forming Groups: The function iterates over the sorted keys, and for each key, it tries to form num_groups consecutive groups starting from that card. If at any point there aren't enough cards to form a complete group, it returns False.
# Reducing Count: For each card used in forming the groups, the count is reduced accordingly.
# This code ensures there are no runtime errors and correctly determines whether the hand can be rearranged into the specified groups.
